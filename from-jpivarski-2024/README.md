In JupyterLite, the slides and notebooks can all be found in the left-bar (which may be hidden; click the folder icon to reveal them). Each can be opened by double-clicking.

In a notebook, you can run a cell by clicking in it and pressing `shift-enter` or `control-enter` (or `command-enter` on Mac). If your Python session dies or needs to be restarted, select the last cell you were working on and "Restart Kernel and Run up to Selected Cell" from the "Kernel" menu.
